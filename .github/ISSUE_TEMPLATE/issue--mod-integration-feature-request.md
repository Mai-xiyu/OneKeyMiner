### **Is your integration request related to a problem? Please describe.**

A clear and concise description of the problem or gap this integration would solve.

- Example: *"I'm frustrated when Mod A's energy systems can't connect to Mod B's machines, forcing me to use clunky workarounds."*

- Example: *"There's no way to use Mod A's tools to interact with Mod B's unique blocks, which breaks immersion."*

### **Describe the integration solution you'd like**

A clear and concise description of the cross-mod functionality you want to see.

- Specify the two (or more) mods involved: `[Mod A Name]` and `[Mod B Name]`

- Example: *"Allow Mod A's energy cables to transfer power directly to Mod B's generators and machines."*

- Example: *"Let Mod A's enchants apply their effects when using tools on Mod B's blocks."*

- Explain how this integration would improve the user experience.

### **Describe alternatives you've considered**

A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or workarounds you’ve tried.

- Example: *"I've tried using a third-party bridge mod, but it's outdated and causes crashes."*

- Example: *"I can manually transfer resources between mods, but it's time-consuming and breaks automation."*

### **Additional context**

Add any other context, screenshots, or details to support your integration request.

- Include mod versions: `[Mod A Version]`, `[Mod B Version]`

- Attach screenshots showing the current (broken/limited) interaction

- Link to related issues or discussions in the mods' official repositories
