### **Describe the Compatibility/Integration Issue**

A clear and concise description of the conflict, unexpected interaction, or requested cross-mod integration.

- For issues: Explain what happens when the mods are used together (e.g., crashes, broken mechanics, visual glitches).

- For requests: Describe the cross-mod functionality you want to see (e.g., item compatibility, shared progression, or feature synergy).

---

### **Steps to Reproduce (for Compatibility Issues) / Integration Request Details (for Feature Requests)**

#### For compatibility issues:

1. Install `[Mod A Name]` (version `[x.y.z]`) and `[Mod B Name]` (version `[x.y.z]`)

2. Load the game with both mods enabled

3. [Trigger the conflicting action, e.g., "Place a Mod A machine near a Mod B pipe"]

4. Observe the issue (e.g., crash, missing functionality, or incorrect behavior)

#### For integration requests:

1. Explain the specific cross-mod behavior you want (e.g., "Allow Mod A tools to harvest Mod B crops")

2. Describe how this integration would improve the user experience

3. Note any relevant edge cases or dependencies

---

### **Expected Outcome**

- For issues: What you expected to happen when using the mods together (e.g., "The machine and pipe should connect and transfer resources normally").

- For requests: What the ideal integration would look like (e.g., "Mod A tools should grant the same harvest speed and drops as Mod B's native tools").

---

### **Evidence (Screenshots/Logs)**

If applicable, add screenshots, crash logs, debug outputs, or video clips to explain the issue or support your request.

- Crash logs: Paste a link to a pastebin/Gist or attach the file directly.

- Screenshots: Highlight the visual glitch or conflicting behavior.
